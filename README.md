### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Alegria and I live in Aveiro,Portugal.
I'm a software engineer with close to 3 years of experience in the development, validation, and maintenance of software applications. Those systems were mainly based on a micro-service architecture, using brokers to exchange information and leveraging DevOps concepts, such as CI/CD. 

I really enjoy a good challenge and I'm eager to learn more. A maker at heart.
